        Overview
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a subproject of <b>jcel</b> and contains the core ontology.
        This means that this subproject contains all normalized axioms.
      <h2>
        Package dependencies
      </h2>
      <p>
        If we consider each package as a node, and each dependency
        between two packages as a directed edge, the structure of
        package dependency should be a directed acyclic graph
        (DAG). The packages should only make public those classes
        that are or could be used by another package preserving the
        DAG structure.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Preconditions and postconditions
      </h2>
      <p>
        As a general rule, all the public methods reject any
        null argument. The only exception to this rule is
        the method public boolean equals(Object o) which
        can accept a null argument.<br>
        When a null argument is passed to a public method,
        it throws an IllegalArgumentException with the
        content "Null argument.".<br>
        The public methods never return a null value,
        except when it is specifically said in the javadoc.
